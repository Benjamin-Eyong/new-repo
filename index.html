        <p class="card-text">I am the youngest of two sons, just like David in the Bible. I belive I am the man after Gods heart thats why I consider myself a son of GOD. Just like David, GOD has been faithful and good to me each time I call, he answers my prayers. One of my favorite verses is Psalms 51 written by David, and it is about the mercy of GOD.</p>

I prefer the K.J.V. version because its original and I also love learinig new verses, sharing verses and it is amazing how we can have the words, thoughts and plan of our Lord and savior in a book. The Bible is the most up to date book in the world it has prophesies that have happen and are still to happen.</p>
